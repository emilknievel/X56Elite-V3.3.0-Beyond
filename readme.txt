[Logitech (Saitek) X56 Elite Dangerous V3.3-Beyond Profile]

This profile is build for VR, Non-VR and head-tracking systems and is VoiceAttack/HCSVoicePacks compatible!
The profile is quite extensive and everything is divided over the 3 modes with almost no re-use of assigned buttons in other modes.
The profile has 3 modes:
- [M1 - Flight/Fight]
- [M2 - Landing/Alternate Flight]
- [S1 - SRV]


Default Mode is M1. M1 is for your normal flying/supercruising/hyperspacing, combat and all things related.
To land switch to Mode M2. This gives you an different set of controls just for landing.
This mode is not much different then flying, except some "flight features" are disabled.
This way I eliminated the accidental boost when landing.
And Finally Mode S1, which is for SRV and will not have the other functions for flying.
